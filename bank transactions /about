this project requires us to :
1. Split the Transaction Code to extract the letters at the start of the transaction code. These identify the bank who processes the transaction  
2. Rename the values in the Online or In-person field, Online of the 1 values and In-Person for the 2 values. 
3. Different levels of detail are required in the outputs. You will need to sum up the values of the transactions in three ways :
  a. Total Values of Transactions by each bank
  b. Total Values by Type of Transaction (Online or In-Person)
  c. Total Values by Bank and Customer Code
4. delete unused columns
5.Output each data file
