This project requires us to 
1. In the Transactions table, there is a Sort Code field which contains dashes. We need to remove these so just have a 6 digit string 
2. Use the SWIFT Bank Code lookup table to bring in additional information about the SWIFT code and Check Digits of the receiving bank account 
3. Add a field for the Country Code Hint: all these transactions take place in the UK so the Country Code should be GB
4. Create the IBAN as above (watch out for trying to combine sting fields with numeric fields - check data types)
5. Remove unnecessary fields 
6. Output the data
